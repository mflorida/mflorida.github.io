# Body content for my shameless self-promotional web page.
# In YAML format, because hipster.

content:
  body:

    - tag: div
      ___HTML___: <hr>

    - tag: p
      ~id: xyz  # this will not be parsed for rendering since it starts with `~`
      props:
        $class: m-t-20
      children: >
        This is the first paragraph. It uses `tag` for the tagName and `content` for its contents.

    - tag: p
      children: > 
        This is the second paragraph. It uses `type` for the tagName and `children` for its contents.
        These are the same property names used in React, so shold be a familiar pattern.

    - tag: div
      props:
        _id: paragraph-3
        _className: yet-another-paragraph
        _title: Whatever
          # 'style' gets special handling
        style: "color:cornflowerblue;"
      children:
        - ___HTML___: > 
            This is the third paragraph. It uses an array with the pattern `[tag, props, children]`. 
            Below are some things to note:
        - ___HTML___: "<br><br>"
        - tag: ul
          props:
            $class: m-t-20
            $title: Yo. I'm the UL!!!
            $data-what: ???
          children:
            -
              - li
              - $data-foo: array-type
                $data-bar: 3-items
                attr:
                  title: 3-element array
                  data-baz: 3-elements
              - >
                An element defined this way *must* use an array with 3 elements.
            - tag: li
              props:
                _title: Children but no props
              children: >
                If there are `children` but no `props` options, pass an empty object or any 
                falsey value as the second argument.
            - tag: li
              ___HTML___: >
                <!-- the '___HTML___' will be stripped from the output -->
                <i>Probably some other stuff too<i>
            - tag: li
              children: >
                Though not recommend, if your content source is known to be 'clean', you can pass 
                raw HTML as a value of an '___HTML___' prop, or as a string that starts
                with '___HTML___' for the third `children` argument.
